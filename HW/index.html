 <h1>Mechanical keyboard vs. Generic keyboard</h1>
 <p> <hr>

    Introduction :
    The concept of keyboard is integrated into everyone’s mind in this generation. It comes in many form but primarily it’s either physical or digital.
    
     
    
    But we are going to talk about two different sort of keyboards that most people use. That is mechanical and generic subsequently. Generic keyboards are the ones that have membrane switches, no presence of mechanical switch what so ever.
    
     
    
    On the other hand, mechanical ones are with mechanical switches. To differentiate between the two, mechanical keyboards are way louder than generic ones and they have much more key distance time than generic ones. Once you are pro enough, you will be able to create distinction between both of them just by their outlooks. <br>

    Buttons :
    The deciding factor between generic and mechanical keyboard comes down the switches that they use individually. Now these switches comes in different button options. Generic keyboards mostly comes with chicklet style buttons which have very less key distance time but have really firm touch to them . They don’t create too much distraction when the user uses it.
    
     
    
    On the contrary, mechanical switches come in a lot of button options. Cherry MX being one of the most popular of them, it comes in brown switches, red switches, blue switches etc. The main difference between the different colors switches are only in how they sound.<br>

    Price :
    As generic keyboards do not consist of complex engineering structure, they come at a very cheap price when compared to the mechanical keyboards. The good ones like apple keyboard do cost a fortune but that is targeted at certain group of people. Otherwise, generic keyboards can cost as low as 3 dollars.
    
     
    
    But mechanical keyboards cost a lot as they have somewhat complex engineering infrastructure. Not only the switches but also the IC, polling rate, the braiding cost extra money to manufacture. The cheapest legitimate mechanical keyboards start from 30 dollars which is 27 dollars more than the cheapest generic keyboard option.<br>

    Usage case :
    Generic keyboard being very simple and having a low-key theme to it, it is suitable for office, labs and other mass use cases. If mechanical keyboards are used here, the budget would get sky high and the distraction would hamper the performance of the users.
    
     
    
    When it comes to personal use and you have some money on your hand, it always nice to get a mechanical keyboard. As you are going to be in your room and with some of your friends time to time, it would be really cool to have mechanical keyboard to yourself. The clicky sounds are oddly satisfying and the aesthetics of a minimal mechanical keyboard pleases your mind.<br>

    Conclusion :
    All the necessary attributes about generic keyboards and mechanical keyboards have been broken down thoroughly throughout the article. It really comes down to the use case for you. Both have their distinct roles and use cases and one should decide which use do they have. <br>
